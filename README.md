# 🕸️ DarkOrbit Auction Scraper

This project is what we call a "Hub Experience" in EPITECH. The purpose is to discover something new, explore new technologies and try to learn things that are not in our studies.

With this project I'm discovering the world of scraping, with a bot that is able to extract auctions prices on an old game named "DarkOrbit". The project consist in the creation of a bot that is able to self login and navigate in the different servers of the game. Then it is able to clone the page and inspect it to find specific values.
